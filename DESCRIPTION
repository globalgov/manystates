Title: Many Data on State and State-Like Actors in the International System
Version: 1.0.3
Date: 2025-10-20
Description: Comprehensively identifying states and state-like actors is difficult.
    This package provides data on states and state-like entities in the international system across time.
    The package combines and cross-references several existing datasets consistent with the aims and functions of the manydata package.
    It also includes functions for identifying state references in text, and for generating fictional state names.
