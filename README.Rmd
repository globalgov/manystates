`manystates` is a data package within the
[many universe of packages](https://github.com/globalgov).
It contains an ensemble of datasets currently available on states and 
state-like entities in the world,
including information on states' beginning and, where applicable, end dates,
and geographical characteristics. 
An important aim of `manystates` is to record and include states as far back in history as possible. 
The package is geared towards global governance research, 
but can also be used by anyone interested in state actors across time. 

Please also check out [`{manydata}`](https://github.com/globalgov/manydata) for
more information about the other packages and tools to handle data from the
many universe of packages. 

## How to install

We've made it easier than ever to install and start analysing global governance
data in R. Simply install the core package,
[manydata](https://github.com/globalgov/manydata), as follows,
and then you can discover, install and update various 'many packages' from the
console.

```{r install, eval= FALSE}
manydata::call_packages() # this prints a list of the publicly available data packages currently available
# manydata::call_packages("manystates") # this downloads and installs the named package
```

## Included data

Once you have installed the package, you can access the primary datacube in the
package, `states`, as follows.
You can see that currently the datacube combines three datasets:
Gleditsch and Ward's (1999) state list,
the International System(s) Dataset (ISD) by Griffiths and Butcher (2013),
and the state list developed by Hollway, Sposito, and Tan (2021) for
this package.

```{r datasets, eval = TRUE}
manydata::describe_datacube(manystates::states)
manystates::states
```

Working with ensembles of related data has many advantages for robust analysis.
Just take a look at our vignettes [here](https://globalgov.github.io/manydata/articles/user.html).

## Included functions

In addition to the datasets, the package also includes a number of
functions that help you work with state data.
`code_states()` is a particularly useful function that helps you
identify states or state-like entities when referenced within text data.
By default it will identify the first state mentioned in each text,
but it is possible to look for multiple states by setting the
`max_count` argument to a value greater than 1.
By default, the function will return ISO 3166 alpha-3 codes,
but it is possible to return a standardised state name instead.

```{r codestates, eval = TRUE}
manystates::code_states(c("This was done in the United Kingdom", 
            "Switzerland and New Zealand made an agreement"),
            max_count = 2)
```

Additionally, there is a somewhat whimsical function that generates
a number of random state names.
This function is inspired by observed state names,
but is not intended to reflect any actual states.
It is primarily designed for use in class exercises when a number of novel
state names are required.
It can also be used to generate fictional state names for
creative writing or games.

```{r genstates, eval = TRUE}
manystates::generate_states(3)
```

Feedback on either of these functions is most welcome.

## Many packages

The development of [many packages](https://github.com/globalgov/manydata) is aimed
at collecting, connecting and correcting network data across issue-domains of
global governance.

While some 'many packages' can and do include novel data,
much of what they offer involves standing on the shoulders of giants.
'many packages' endeavour to be as transparent as possible about where data
comes from, how it has been coded and/or relabelled, and who has done the work.
As such, we make it easy to cite the datasets you use
by listing the official references using the function above,
as well as the package providers for their work assembling the data
by using the function below.

```{r cites}
citation("manystates")
```

## Contributing

If you have already developed a dataset salient to this package,
please reach out by flagging this as an [issue](https://github.com/globalgov/manystates/issues)
for us, or by forking, further developing the package yourself, and opening a
[pull request](https://github.com/globalgov/manystates/pulls)
so that your data can be used easily.

If you have collected or developed other data that may not be best for this
package, but could be useful within the wider universe of `many packages`, 
[`{manypkgs}`](https://github.com/globalgov/manypkgs) includes a number of
functions that make it easy to create a new `many package` and populate it with
clean, consistent global governance data.

If you have any other ideas about how this package or the manydata 
universe more broadly might better facilitate your empirical analysis, we'd be
very happy to hear from you.
