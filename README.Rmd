`manystates` is a data package within the [`{manydata}` ecosystem](https://github.com/globalgov) of qPackages. It contains an ensemble of datasets currently available on states in the world, including information on states' beginning and, where applicable, end dates, regime characteristics, and state leaders. An important aim of `manystates` is to record and include states as far back in history as possible. The package is geared towards global governance research, but can also be used by anyone interested in state actors across time. 

Please also check out [`{manydata}`](https://github.com/globalgov/manydata) for more information about the other packages and tools to handle data from the `{manydata}` ecosystem. 

## How to install

We've made it easier than ever to install and start analysing global governance data in R.
Simply install the core package, [manydata](https://github.com/globalgov/manydata), as follows,
and then you can discover, install and update various qPackages from the console.

```{r install, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages(remotes)
remotes::install_github("globalgov/manydata") # this installs our core package, the only one you need to do independently
manydata::get_packages() # this prints a list of the publicly available data packages currently available
manydata::get_packages("manystates") # this downloads and installs the named package
```

## Data included

Once you have installed `{manydata}`, you can see the different databases and datasets
included in the `{manystates}` package using the following function.

```{r datasets, eval = FALSE}
manydata::data_contrast("manystates")
```

Working with ensembles of related data has many advantages for robust analysis.
Just take a look at our vignettes [here](https://globalgov.github.io/manydata/articles/user.html).

## qPackages

The [manydata](https://github.com/globalgov/manydata) ecosystem is aimed at collecting, connecting and correcting network data across issue-domains of global governance.

While some qPackages can and do include novel data,
much of what they offer involves standing on the shoulders of giants.
qPackages endeavour to be as transparent as possible about where data comes from, 
how it has been coded and/or relabelled, and who has done the work.
As such, we make it easy to cite the datasets you use
by listing the official references using the function above,
as well as the package providers for their work assembling the data
by using the function below.

```{r cites}
citation("manystates")
```

## Contributing

[manydata](https://github.com/globalgov/manydata/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) also makes it easy to contribute in lots of different ways.

If you have already developed a dataset salient to this package,
please reach out by flagging this as an [issue](https://github.com/globalgov/manystates/issues) for us,
or by forking, further developing the package yourself, and opening a [pull request](https://github.com/globalgov/manystates/pulls)
so that your data can be used easily.

If you have collected or developed other data that may not be best for this package,
but could be useful within the wider ecosystem, 
[manydata](https://github.com/globalgov/manydata) includes a number of functions that make it easy
to create a new qPackage and populate with clean, consistent global governance data.

If you have any other ideas about how this package or the manydata ecosystem more broadly
might better facilitate your empirical analysis, we'd be very happy to hear from you.
