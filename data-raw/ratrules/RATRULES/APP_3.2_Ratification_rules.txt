                                                      Appendix 3.2 Ratification Rules

The variable on ratification is based on descriptions in national constitutions for how a treaty is formally ratified. The ratification scale is conceptualized as the institutional “hurdle” that must be overcome in order to get a treaty ratified. This scale refers to the breadth of political support necessary for ratification. The broader the political support necessary for ratification, the higher the hurdle and the higher the ratification score. Note that we code procedures as outlined in the national constitution or basic law. No effort is made to code informal or unofficial procedures for treaty ratification.

The following scale is used for coding ratification procedures:

1  = individual chief executive or cabinet decision

1.5 = rule or tradition of informing legislative body of signed treaties

2   = majority consent of one legislative body

3   = super-majority in one body or majority in two separate legislative bodies

4   = national plebiscite

1983: The President of the Federation may conclude treaties. Those treaties which do not come under the authority of the House of Representatives may be directly implemented by the President. Political treaties or treaties that modify or complement existing laws must be approved by a 2/3 vote of the House of Representatives where at least 1/3 of all members are present to vote. Any measure that would revise the Constitution requires the above measure in addition to a national referendum for total changes to the constitution and a partial change requires a referendum only if 1/3 of the Representatives and Senators request. The Senate must not object to the passage of the treaty through the House. The President signs all laws passed by the House.

2000: Individual states, or Lander, can conclude treaties within their competence as long as the Federal Council has approved to the negotiations. Additionally, the treaties must be approved by the Federal Council. Consent is assumed if the Federal Chancellor does not notify the Landner of his disapproval within 8 weeks of his notification of the conclusion of a treaty. Political State treaties which amend or supplement the law cannot be concluded by Lander, but only by the National Council (district representation) and require the consent of the Federal Council (representation in seats by proprtion of population in district). The National Council submits treaty approval to the Federal Council______
